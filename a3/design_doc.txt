Game Upgrade for 2 players

We will be taking our existing game, remove the wall and replace it with another player. 

Gameplay will be slightly different. Scores will be similar to ping-pong, the ball will travel between the two and whoever fails to hit it back will lose the point. 

We will need to add a toggle for the sound. 

Our plan is to have the original player, player 1, be the 'server'. Player 1 will wait until player 2 requests to join. 

We will have to look into the specific implementation of the server but the basic idea is that when the game starts up, it will attempt to send a request to be player 2 to the server. If this request fails to succeed, then the process will assume it is player 1, and proceed. 

The other idea is to specifically have two games, one for player1 and one for player 2. All player 2 should do is communicate with player 1. We have a feeling that this will be difficult to implement.
