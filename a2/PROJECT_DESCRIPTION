CS354R - Assignment 2 (Single Player Engine and Game)
=================================

RUNNING
=================================
1. Consult README for instructions on building.
2. run the RacquetApp executable (./RacquetApp)

IMPLEMENTATION
=================================
//This implementation of Ball in Room uses red-orange ambient lighting with a red point light, a dark green directional light, and a blue spotlight. 4 balls of random directional velocity are provided on startup. 

ADDITIONAL FEATURES
=================================
//1. Bullet Integration for gravity and collision handling between all objects in the world.
//2. Left click instantiates a new ball with upward velocity.
//3. Right click will cycle between gravity settings (off => upward => downward)
//4. Ball entity color properties are changed to provide more diffuse and specular coloration from surrounding lighting. They also cast shadows on the environment.
//5. The ground is textured with Rockwall.
//6. Camera with mouse and keyboard (WASD) controls.
