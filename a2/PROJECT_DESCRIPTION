CS354R - Assignment 1 (Ball Room)
=================================

RUNNING
=================================
1. Consult README for instructions on building.
2. run the BallApp executable (./BallApp)

IMPLEMENTATION
=================================
This implementation of Ball in Room uses red-orange ambient lighting with a red point light, a dark green directional light, and a blue spotlight. 4 balls of random directional velocity are provided on startup. 

ADDITIONAL FEATURES
=================================
1. Bullet Integration for gravity and collision handling between all objects in the world.
2. Left click instantiates a new ball with upward velocity.
3. Right click will cycle between gravity settings (off => upward => downward)
4. Ball entity color properties are changed to provide more diffuse and specular coloration from surrounding lighting. They also cast shadows on the environment.
5. The ground is textured with Rockwall.
6. Camera with mouse and keyboard (WASD) controls.

FILES
=================================
BaseApplication.cpp, BaseApplication.h (Modified slightly to show Gravity status in advanced stats)
BallApp.cpp, BallApp.h (Main application files)
Physics.cpp, Physics.h (Bullet integration helper files)
