Project Proposal: Super Ogre Ball
Kevin Yeh, Patrick Greyson, Alyssa Sallean

Game Overview:
The game will consist of a platform that the user will tilt with the arrow keys. There will be a ball that will roll around on the platform and the player will have to get the ball through the goal.There will be a series of levels where you have 60 seconds to get the ball through the target. Each level will have challenges that the player has to navigate through. If the player goes off the edge, he will lose a life and get to try again. Once the player has lost too many lives, he will have to start over from the beginning of the series of levels.  The game is intended to be single player, but depending on time constraints, we may add in a multiplayer option for fun. 

Game controls:
The player will use the Wiimote to pitch, yaw, and tilt the platform. The platform will return to flat if the player does not tilt the wiimote. There will also be an option to use the arrow keys on the keyboard. 

Coding:
We will be making a new game, but we can take many things straight out of our current implementation, such as static classes for sound and networking. The biggest challenges will be writing the levels, and making everything run smoothly. We will need an abstract class for the levels, as well a class for the player character.
