CS354R - Assignment 1 (Ball Room)
=================================

BUILDING
=================================
1. Edit plugins.cfg so that the correct PluginsFolder variable is used.
2. Edit Makefile.am and make sure BallApp_CPPFLAGS is pointing to your bullet installation folder.
3. If building on OGRE 1.7, ensure that ogre.cfg does not exist or that the Fixed_Pipeline setting is removed before running the BallApp executable.
